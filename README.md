# Custom Objects
Blender Add-on - Adds meshes, lights and probes scaled to Unreal dimensions.

Designed for people who work in Blender at 0.01 unit scale, gives you a handful of objects scaled up so you don't have to adjust the same settings every time you add a mesh, light or camera. This now includes a basic armature that will work with Unreal, as well as some hard surface and mirrored modelling shortcuts.

## How to Install
Download and unzip files, then install by opening __Blender__, selecting __Edit__ > __Preferences__ > __Addons__ > __Install__ then select __CustomObjects.py__ and click __Install Addon__

## How to Use

By default, the panel will appear in the 3D Viewport below the Tools. You can turn this off via the Addon Preferences.
The objects are also available via the Add Menu, or by searching.

Click on an object to create it at the centre of your scene. If you aren't happy with the default size of the mesh, or the brightness of the light, you can adjust these settings via the Addon Preferences.

The Extras Panel contains more complex objects, meshes that have one or more modifiers applied, in addition to transforms. If you wish to add your own custom objects/workflows, check out the code in this section.
