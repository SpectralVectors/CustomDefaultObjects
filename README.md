# Custom Objects
Blender Add-on - Adds meshes, lights and probes scaled to Unreal dimensions

Designed for people who work in Blender at 0.01 unit scale, 
gives you a handful of objects scaled up so you don't have to adjust the same 
settings every time you add a mesh, light or camera. This now includes a basic armature that will work with Unreal, as well as some hard surface and mirrored modelling shortcuts.

Feel free to download, change and use the script as you see fit, giving credit to where you got it. Just download the .py, then, in Blender, go to Edit > Preferences > Add-ons > Install... then select the .py. If you want to make changes, you can click the Remove button, change UnrealObjectsPanel.py, save it, then add it again, same way as the first.
